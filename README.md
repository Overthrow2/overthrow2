# Overthrow 2

Overthrow at its core is an incredibly fun game.  However, sadly, it is often neglected by Valve.  The last time it received a balance update was June of 2016.  This has allowed several heroes to become nearly unpickable, while others who benefited from other patches and item changes have become dominant.

Overthrow 2 is an attempt to make Overthrow more fun and balanced, and also give the game mode an active developer to keep up with the constantly evolving landscape of Dota 2.

The initial release will include a sweeping amount of changes - and probably be barely any more balanced than the current game, just shifting who is best!  But we have to start somewhere.  We plan on updating the map as frequently as needed, after observing the state of the game each change, to slowly adjust the heroes and items to be more fun.

There are NO PLANS for any custom heroes, abilities, or items.  Overthrow should continue to be "Dota Deathmatch Mode", and moving away from Dota's items and heroes moves away from that purpose.

In addition to working out which heroes are overpowered and giving them slight adjustments, we hope to bring weaker heroes up to their level.  This includes changing some heroes to be more suited for "arena-style" combat, by decreasing cooldowns and durations of abilities to make them better suited for fast-paced situations and short matches.  We will also be adjusting minor things to make sure all heroes feel suitable for the maps, like playing around with trees (for Monkey King and Timbersaw) and neutral creeps (for Enchantress, Chen, Doom, Clinkz, etc).
